# ‚è∞Splunk SIEM Monitoring Solution Project

## üéØOverview
Developed and designed a custom monitoring environment as part of the cyber security incident response in order to protect a fictional organization from potential cyberattacks using Splunk SIEM (Security Information and Event Management).

## üì∫Scenario
Played the role of a SOC analyst at a company called Virtual Space Industries (VSI). VSI has received information that another company, JobeCorp, may launch cyberattacks to disrupt VSI‚Äôs business. We were tasked with using Splunk to develop a monitoring environment to monitor Windows OS, which runs many of VSI's back-end operations and Apacher web sever, which hosts the administrative webpag. This monitoring environment can protect against potential cyberattacks on VSI‚Äôs systems and applications. 


## üîëKey Achievements
1. Analyzed Windows and Apache Servers Logs to gain insights into server activities and establish a baseline for normal behavior. This baseline helps detect anomalies by analyzing key parameters such as severity levels, failed and successful events, event volume, signatures, and user activity.

2. Designed and implemented a custom monitoring solution such as alerts, reports and dashboards based on the established baseline. These alerts automatically notify the designated security personnel via email whenever activity surpasses the defined threshold, enabling real-time detection and response to potential threats.

3. Analyzed Windows and Apache Servers Attack Logs with our monitoring solution to determine the efficacy of our solution. These new ‚Äúattack logs‚Äù cover the time period during which the attack occurred. 

4. Strengthened monitoring capabilities by integrating a user-friendly dashboard within the Splunk app. This enhanced visibility into security events, providing a more comprehensive view of data to improve threat detection and defense against cyberattacks.
